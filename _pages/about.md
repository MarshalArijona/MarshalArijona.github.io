Hi, I am Marshal Sinaga. Currently, I am a doctoral researcher at the faculty of computer science, Aalto university. I obtained both my bachelor and master degree from the faculty of computer science, university of Indonesia. My research interest is to build reliable probabilistic machine learning systems which can generalize to unseen data. My research interests include:

- Bayesian experimental design
- Bayesian optimization
- Bayesian neural network

Aside from that, I have interests in Gaussian process. In the past, my works gravitated to deep representation learning and deep generative models for images.
