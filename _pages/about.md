Hi, I am Marshal Sinaga. I am a doctoral researcher at the probabilistic machine learning Aalto University. I am honored to be supervised by <a href='https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski'> Prof. Samuel Kaski </a>. Before this, I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees from the faculty of computer science at the University of Indonesia. My research interests include:

- Bayesian optimization/experimental design
- Bayesian neural network

with the human-in-the-loop aspects. Aside from that, I have an interest in the Gaussian process. In the past, my works gravitated to deep representation learning and deep generative models for images.
