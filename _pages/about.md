I am Marshal Sinaga, a doctoral researcher at <a href='https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/'>Aalto probabilistic machine learning group</a>. It's my honor to be supervised by <a href='https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/samuel-kaski'> Samuel Kaski </a> and <a href='https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/vikas-garg'> Vikas Garg </a>. During my doctoral program, I am fully funded by <a href='https://fcai.fi/'> Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI) </a>. Previously, I was a research assistant at <a href='https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/'>Department of System Engineering and Engineering Management CUHK</a> and <a href='https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/group/'>Aalto ML research group </a>. I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees from the faculty of computer science, University of Indonesia. 

Research interests: My primary focus lies in probabilistic machine learning, particularly in the realm of Bayesian optimization. Within this domain, I delve into various facets, including human-in-the-loop settings, noisy information, model misspecification, and covariate shift.
