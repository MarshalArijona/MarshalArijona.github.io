Hi, I am Marshal Sinaga. I finished my Master's degree from the Faculty of Computer Science, University of Indonesia. Before my Master's, I obtained my Bachelor's in Computer Science from the same institution. My research interests include Bayesian inference methods (with the applications in uncertainty quantification and representation learning) and information theory.
