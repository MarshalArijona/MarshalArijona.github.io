Hi, I am Marshal Sinaga, a doctoral researcher at the probabilistic machine learning Aalto University. It's my honor to be supervised by <a href='https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski'> Samuel Kaski </a> and <a href='https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/vikas-garg'> Vikas Garg </a>. During my doctoral program, I am fully funded by the <a href='https://fcai.fi/'> Finnish Center of Artificial Intelligence (FCAI) </a>. Before this, I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees from the faculty of computer science at the University of Indonesia. My research interests include:

- Bayesian optimization/experimental design
- Bayesian neural network
- Gaussian process

with human-in-the-loop aspects. In the past, my works gravitated to deep representation learning and deep generative models for images.

*For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain*
