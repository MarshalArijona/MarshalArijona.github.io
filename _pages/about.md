I am Marshal Sinaga, a doctoral researcher at <a href='https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/'>Aalto probabilistic machine learning group</a>. It's my honor to be supervised by <a href='https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/samuel-kaski'> Samuel Kaski </a>. Previously, I was a research assistant at <a href='https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/'>Department of System Engineering and Engineering Management CUHK</a> (with <a href='https://www.vietanhnguyen.net/'> Viet Anh Nguyen </a>) and <a href='https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/group/'>Aalto ML research group </a> (with <a href='https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/'> Arno Solin </a>). I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees from the faculty of computer science, University of Indonesia. 

My primary research focus is probabilistic machine learning, with a particular emphasis on Bayesian optimization. Within this area, I explore a range of topics, including human-in-the-loop frameworks, robust methods for handling outliers, model calibration, and optimization in high-dimensional spaces.
