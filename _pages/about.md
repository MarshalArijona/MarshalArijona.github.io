Hi, I am Marshal Sinaga. Currently, I am a doctoral researcher at the probabilistic machine learning group, Aalto university. I am very honoured to be supervised by Prof. Samuel Kaski. Prior, I obtained both my bachelor and master degree from the faculty of computer science, university of Indonesia. My research interests include:

- Bayesian experimental design
- Bayesian optimization
- Bayesian neural network

Aside from that, I have interests in Gaussian process. In the past, my works gravitated to deep representation learning and deep generative models for images.
