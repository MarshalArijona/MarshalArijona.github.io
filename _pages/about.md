I am Marshal Sinaga, a doctoral researcher at the probabilistic machine learning Aalto University. It's my honor to be supervised by <a href='https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski'> Samuel Kaski </a> and <a href='https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/vikas-garg'> Vikas Garg </a>. During my doctoral program, I am fully funded by <a href='https://fcai.fi/'> Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI) </a>. Before this, I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees from the computer science faculty at the University of Indonesia. 

**Research interests**: Bayesian optimization; emphasizing multi-source, noisy information and human-in-the-loop aspects.

Other interests include bouldering, music, chess, and languages.
