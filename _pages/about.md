I am Marshal Sinaga, a doctoral researcher at <a href='https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/'>Aalto probabilistic machine learning group</a>. It's my honor to be supervised by <a href='https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/samuel-kaski'> Samuel Kaski </a> and <a href='https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/vikas-garg'> Vikas Garg </a>. During my doctoral program, I am fully funded by <a href='https://fcai.fi/'> Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI) </a>. Previously, I was a research assistant at <a href='https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/'>Department of System Engineering and Engineering Management CUHK</a> (with <a href='https://www.vietanhnguyen.net/'> Viet Anh Nguyen </a>) and <a href='https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/group/'>Aalto ML research group </a> (with <a href='https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/'> Arno Solin </a>). I obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees from the faculty of computer science, University of Indonesia. 

My primary focus lies in probabilistic machine learning, particularly in the realm of Bayesian optimization. Within this domain, I delve into various facets, including human-in-the-loop settings, noisy information, model misspecification, and covariate shift.
