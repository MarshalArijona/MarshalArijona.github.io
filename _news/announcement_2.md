Starting in June, I am a doctoral researcher in the probabilistic machine learning group, at Aalto University. I will be supervised by <a href='https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski'> Samuel Kaski </a> and <a href='[https://www.aalto.fi/en/people/vikas-kumar-garg](https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/vikas-garg)'> Vikas Garg </a>. My research will revolve around Bayesian optimization/experimental design with human-in-the-loop aspects.
