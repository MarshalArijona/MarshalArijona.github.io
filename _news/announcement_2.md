<!--Starting in June, I am a doctoral researcher in the probabilistic machine learning group, at Aalto University. I will be supervised by <a href='https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski'> Samuel Kaski </a> and <a href='https://research.aalto.fi/en/persons/vikas-garg'> Vikas Garg </a>. My research will revolve around Bayesian optimization/experimental design with human-in-the-loop aspects. -->

Camera-ready version of our paper <a href='assets/pdf/heteroscedasticPBO_neurips2023.pdf'> Heteroscedastic Preferential Bayesian Optimization with Informative Priors </a> is now available.
