Starting in June, I am a doctoral researcher in the probabilistic machine learning group, at Aalto University. I will be supervised by Prof. Samuel Kaski and Vikas Garg. My research will revolve around Bayesian optimization/experimental design, and Bayesian neural network with human-in-the-loop aspects.
