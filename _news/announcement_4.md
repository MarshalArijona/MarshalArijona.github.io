Starting in June, I am a research assistant in the Department of Computer Science, at Aalto University. I will collaborate with <a href='https://trappmartin.github.io/website/'> Martin Trapp </a> and <a href='https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/'> Arno Solin </a>. We will work on the periodic activation function in the Bayesian neural network.
